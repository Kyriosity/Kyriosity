IT & Software. Here I'd like to share the following writing and development:
| [READ-WRITE](../../../read-write/) | [USE-DEV](../../../use-dev) |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **reviews**, **proposals**, **guidelines**,<br/>_where I emphasize my own experience_,<br/>_trying to avoid triviality and obviousness_.  | **design decisions** & **pragmatic projects**,<br/>_which cover essential tasks, and may_<br/>_become a part of your application_. |
