Here I'd like to share the following writing and development:
| [read-write](../../../read-write) | [use-dev](../../../use-dev) |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **reviews**, **proposals**, **guidelines**,<br/>_where I emphasize my own experience_,<br/>_trying to avoid triviality and obviousness_.  | **use-oriented projects**,<br/>_which cover essential tasks_<br/>_in a way better than found_. |
