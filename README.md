Repositories here host the following subjects of IMHO&nbsp;<sup>:one:</sup>

- [reviews, proposals, guidelines](../../../read-write), where I emphasize my own experience and try to avoid triviality
- [concept-driven projects](../../../use-dev), that can be a help for your dev

___________________
<sup>:one:</sup> In my humble opinion. I could have misunderstood and missed some points. Errors and outdated statements are also possible.\
Thus, rational review, critique, or contribution is very welcome.
